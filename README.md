# Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. It was originally developed at LinkedIn and later became an open-source Apache project in 2011. Kafka is written in Scala and Java and offers a robust platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

## Features

- **High Throughput**: Capable of handling high-velocity and high-volume data.
- **Scalable**: Easily scales horizontally by adding more nodes.
- **Durable**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance.
- **Distributed**: Supports distributed processing of data streams.
- **Fault-tolerant**: Provides resilience to system failures.
